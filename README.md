# React Static Components

## About this Build

You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

So you decide to look into some analytical tools...but wow! They are expensive! You decide to make your own.

You visualize a dashboard with compontents for reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis and website visitors

Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components (e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website visitors).

## Get Started

- `how would you get started? What do you need?`
- `Think about how many components you need`
- `What need to be passed through and what doesn't?`

### Set up

- `mkdir dashboard`
- `cd dashboard`
- `create-react-app dashboard`
- `cd into dashboard`
- `open it in your favorite text editor`
- `in terminal run "npm start" to track live changes`

**app.js**

- render an `h1` tag using react to test it:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render( <h1>Commence Dashboard Creation!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));ument.getElementById('root'));
);
```

- `once you confirm that it renders begin building out your dashboard`
- `to get you started, change the h1 above into <App />`

### Dark Theme!

Keep going! Add more details, add some css
