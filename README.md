# React Static Components

![React Dashboard mockup](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/17300/files/4a24d580-ae40-11eb-966b-75de62388298)

Use React to recreate this mockup.

## Getting Started

- Breakdown the UI into components.  Consider what parts of the UI are _reusable_.
- Decide on the mark up that you'd like to generate.

## Set Up

1. Change into your sandbox with `cd ~/sei/sandbox`.
1. Fork and clone this repository with `git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:SEIR-412/react-dashboard.git`.
1. Change into the new directory with `cd react-dashboard`.
1. Confirm that you're actually in you're in your `react-dashboard` directory and then run `npx create-react-app .`
1. After it finishes installing and you should see the message that reads `Happy hacking!`. Once you're back at the prompt, type `code .` to open up the project in VS Code.
1. Toggle open the NPM SCRIPTS area in the Explorer pane in VS Code, hover over the item marked `start`, and then click the "play" button that appears on the right to run your server.

## Requirements

Build out the above wireframe in react components. Focus on getting the components to render the different content first.  After you get your content to render, add some styles to your site!  Submit a PR when you're done.
