# React Static Components

You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and
classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

So you decide to look into some analytical tools... but wow! They are expensive!
You decide to make your own.

You visualize a dashboard with components for reviews, average rating, sentiment
analysis and website visitors

![Dashboard Wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/5mCo2tV.png)

Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components
(e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website
visitors).

## Instructions

1. Change into your sandbox with `cd ~/sei/sandbox`.
1. Fork and clone this repository with `git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:SEIR-412/react-dashboard.git`.
1. Change into the new directory with `cd react-dashboard`.
1. Confirm that you're actually in you're in your `react-dashboard` directory and then run `npx create-react-app .`
1. After it finishes installing and you should see the message that reads `Happy hacking!`. Once you're back at the prompt, type `code .` to open up the project in VS Code.
1. Toggle open the NPM SCRIPTS area in the Explorer pane in VS Code, hover over the item marked `start`, and then click the "play" button that appears on the right to run your server.

## Requirements

Build out the above wireframe in react components. This is all static, so you
don't need to do anything with props unless you want to.

## Get Started

- Consider the mark up that you'd like to generate.
- What parts of the UI are reusable?

### Bonus: Dark Theme!

Keep going! Add more details, add some css
